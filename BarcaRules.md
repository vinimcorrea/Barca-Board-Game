## **Description**

Played on a 10x10 checkered board, each player controls 6 animals of 3 different types.
- The Mouse can move orthogonally (horizontal or vertical) and is 'scared' of the Lion.
- The Lion can move diagonally (it's color locked) and is 'scared' of the Elephant.
- The Elephant can move both orthogonally and diagonally and is 'scared' of the Mouse. 

Each piece can move as far as it can on its intended line of travel as long as it's not within the square perimeter (orthogonal and diagonal) of the animal its afraid of.

The goal of the game is to control 3 of the 4 'watering holes' at the end of your turn. However, if your piece is next to a piece (orthogonal AND diagonal) that it is 'scared' of it MUST move on your next turn. You cannot move a piece next to a piece (orthogonal AND diagonal) that it is 'scared' of.


## **Objective of the game**

Get any 3 of your animals on the watering holes at the same time.


## **Set Up**

Set the game board between both players.
Place the elephants in the center of each player’s back row.
Place the mice in front of the elephants. 
Place the lions to the sides of the mice.


## **Rules**

Players take turns moving one of their animals.

Mice move horizontally or vertically.
Lions only move diagonally.
Elephants move horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
Animals can move any number of vacant squares in a single direction. Animals cannot jump over other animals.

A players’ animals can be adjacent to each other. However, for opposing sides, mice fear lions, lions fear elephants, and elephants fear mice.

An animal cannot be moved next to the animal it fears, except for trapped animals.

An animal is scared when it is next to the animal it fears. A scared animal must escape to a safe location before other animals can be moved. When many are scared, choose one to move. A scared animal with no escape is trapped and may optionally move to another scared position.

Watering holes are near the center of the game board. The player who has animals on 3 watering holes at the same time wins!
 
A player can still win if animals are scared or trapped. Animals are never removed.
